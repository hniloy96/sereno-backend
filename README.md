 - For new users Website/app opens with sign up page.
 - For returning users Website/app opens with home page showing followed artists/friends post. from there user can navigate to profile page where he can create a post (upload audio file and share it with an audience).
    User can also navigate to discover page to find artists that the user doesn't follow 
    User can navigate to albums page to view recently released albums or old albums, and review them or create posts about them.
